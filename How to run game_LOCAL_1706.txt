#By Code blasters 💣
To launch the game , go inside the GameHub folder , right click and select Open in terminal. A powershell window will appear. There you need to run the command "./dist/GameHub.exe". 

P.S. Hide the taskbar for a more immersive experience. Also use the cross provided below the actual cross for closing the game.
